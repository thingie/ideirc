Very basic, unfinished and unpolished IRC identi.ca gateway.

Basicaly it can only imitate semi-functional IRC server and allows you
to send dents.

You have to set nick same as your identica username, then type "password <password>"
on #control channel, and then you can post by typing "post <dent>" on the same channel.

You can have more people connected to the gateway, it works independently for each.

Only dependency (right now) is libcurl, but in order to really support identi.ca API,
some XML library will be neccesary. 

In fact, it'd be more reasonable to rather extend BitlBee, which now has twitter
support.
